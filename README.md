# Endpoint-Monitoring Operator

> A lightweight, extensible Kubernetes Operator that probes *any* endpoint—HTTP/JSON, TCP, DNS, ICMP, Trino, OpenSearch, and more—and routes alerts to Slack or e-mail with a simple Custom Resource.

## Why another monitor?

Traditional uptime checkers only tell you if a port is open. **Endpoint-Monitoring Operator** runs *inside* your cluster, so it can:

* Hit real business URLs such as `/v1/status` that are not exposed publicly.  
* Assert deep JSON fields, not just `HTTP 200`.  
* Validate distributed systems (Trino, OpenSearch) and network primitives (DNS, TCP, Ping).  
* Deliver alerts through pluggable notifiers (Slack today, e-mail and PagerDuty soon). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Supported drivers

| Driver        | Typical use-case                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `http`        | Basic status-code check (200/302/…​)               |
| `http-json`   | Validate JSON payload & status code                |
| `tcp`         | Verify a service is listening on a port            |
| `dns`         | Ensure a domain resolves to expected IP(s)         |
| `ping`        | Simple ICMP reachability                           |
| `trino`       | Confirm Trino coordinator is *READY*               |
| `opensearch`  | Check cluster health is `green` / `yellow`         |
| `smtp`        | Verify a smtp is listening on a port               |

Adding a new driver or notifier is only a few lines—everything is wired through a Factory pattern. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## CRD quick-look

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.licious.app/v1alpha1
kind: EndpointMonitor
metadata:
  name: my-check
spec:
  driver: http-json                 # see table above
  endpoint: https://api.example.com/v1/status
  checkInterval: 30                 # seconds
  httpJsonCheck:                    # driver-specific section
    expectedStatusCode: 200
    jsonAssertions:
      status: "UP"
      version: "v1.2.3"
  notify:
    slack:
      enabled: true
      webhookUrl: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ
      alertOn:                       # optional – defaults to ["failure"]
        - success
        - failure
```

Key fields in the spec (abridged):

```
driver – which probe implementation to use
endpoint – URL/host/cluster depending on driver
checkInterval – seconds between probes
notify – list of one or more notifiers (Slack, e-mail)
Driver-specific blocks – e.g. httpJsonCheck for http-json driver
```

See the Go type definitions for the full schema.

## Installation (one-liner)

```kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiciousTech/endpoint-monitoring-operator/main/dist/install.yaml```

### Quick-start examples

#### 1. Monitor DNS resolution
```kubectl apply -f examples/dns.yaml```

#### 2. Deep health-check on a JSON endpoint
```kubectl apply -f examples/http-json.yaml```


## Roadmap

* 🔌 Additional notifiers: PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Webhook
* 🗄️ Persistent metrics export (Prometheus CRD)
* 🕵🏻‍♂️ Synthetic transaction scripts (e.g., login + checkout)
* 🔑 Secretless credentials via CSI Drivers
* ➕ **New drivers:** Redis, MySQL, Kafka
